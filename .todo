TO DO:
- * improve on the mobile XP. looks bad rn. Need to check multiple pages in small screen
- Maybe this will be more user friendly if we just show the highest predicted bucket
- break footer and header apart in CSS

DONE:
- Add GAnalytics
- How it works: Have a link to the medium blog and both github repos.
- Understand: add observations taken, add also "more work in progress"
- ** add "s" to mit confessions and "s" to "scene"
- *** generate page doesn't say "predicting...". fix that asap.
- *** add a progress bar after one clicks on "predict" so that they don't keep clicking and spam the servers
- ** update README
- ** when making a prediction, add an event listener to adjust the footer
- ** remove the default highlighting of the home page when the current-page is not found in the navbar
- ** add a link to the github repo on the navbar
- push the server for predicting onto heroku or somewhere it can run
- Remove all .css and .css.map and just load the scss.
