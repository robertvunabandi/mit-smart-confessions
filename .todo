FOR PRESENTATION:
- don't assume most people don't know mit confessions
- show parallel examples from both the page and the app
- say that we're predicting "likes" and "loves" and all other reactions

TO DO:
- ** write the content for remaining pages:
  - About
  - Understand
  - How it works
- * improve on the mobile XP. looks bad rn. Need to check multiple pages in small screen
- break footer and header apart in CSS

DONE:
- ** add "s" to mit confessions and "s" to "scene"
- *** generate page doesn't say "predicting...". fix that asap.
- *** add a progress bar after one clicks on "predict" so that they don't keep clicking and spam the servers
- ** update README
- ** when making a prediction, add an event listener to adjust the footer
- ** remove the default highlighting of the home page when the current-page is not found in the navbar
- ** add a link to the github repo on the navbar
- push the server for predicting onto heroku or somewhere it can run
- Remove all .css and .css.map and just load the scss.
