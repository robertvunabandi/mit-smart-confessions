FOR PRES:
- don't assume most people don't know mit confessions
- show parallel examples from both the page and the app
- say that we're predicting "likes" and "loves" and all other reactions

TO DO:
- push the server for predicting onto heroku or somewhere it can run
- when making a prediction, add an event listener to adjust the footer
- improve on the mobile XP. looks kinda bad rn.
- add build + watch then run build on the background
- remove the default highlighting of the home page when the current-page is not found in the navbar
- break footer and header apart
- create an event listener for when a prediction is made to reajust the navbar
- write the content for remaining pages:
  - About
  - Understand
  - How it works

DONE:
- Remove all .css and .css.map and just load the scss.
